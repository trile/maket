Sgit remote add origin https://github.com/trile/bootstrap-sass-starter.gituper quick start for development (updated with source from Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6)


## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. run `grunt server` + turn on live-reload on your browsers.

3. Start your development at `app/ejs/index.ejs` and `app/scss/main.scss`

### Notes
- If you dont want to use ejs, you can directly edit the result html file, remember to delete the ejs so it does not override your work.
- If you choose to load bootstrap as an external source file, remove it in your main.sass so it does not get duplicated.
- If you have theme, drop it in `scss` folder and include it in main.scss


## Features

- Include ejs template for reusable components.
- Watch and Live-reload for convenient development.
